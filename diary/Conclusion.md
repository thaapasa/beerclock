# Conclusion

- Compose for Android seems to be mature, and has a lot of
  documenation.
  - Not so for Multiplatform. You'll find documentation and libraries
    for Compose and then be disappointed to find out they're not for
    Multiplatform.
- Very bleeding edge - there's some documentation, but a lot of it is
  contradictory and outdated as the platform keeps changing so fast.
- Getting things working is like upgrading React Native with lots of
  native dependencies - be prepared to debug mysterious build problems
  and scour the net for hard-to-find information.
- Even the libraries specifically designed to Compose Multiplatform
  might not work. The iOS support especially is poor.
- Lots of suggested libraries are in alpha or release candidate stage.
